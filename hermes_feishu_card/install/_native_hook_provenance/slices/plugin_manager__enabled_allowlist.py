    Plugins are opt-in by default — only plugins whose name appears in
    this set are loaded. Returns:

    * ``None`` — the key is missing or malformed. Callers should treat
      this as "nothing enabled yet" (the opt-in default); the first
      ``migrate_config`` run populates the key with a grandfathered set
      of currently-installed user plugins so existing setups don't
      break on upgrade.
    * ``set()`` — an empty list was explicitly set; nothing loads.
    * ``set(...)`` — the concrete allow-list.
