"""The 思考与工具 panel is for thinking and tool work — not for notices alone.

The panel was created whenever the timeline had ANY entry, and notices (a deferred-compression
hint, a skill-loading note) were rendered inside it. A session with no tool calls then showed a
panel headed "思考与工具 · 0 次工具调用": a panel advertising zero of the thing it is named after
while displaying something unrelated. Notices render standalone in that case instead, so the hint
stays visible.
