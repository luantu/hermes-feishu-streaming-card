# Migrating From legacy/dual To sidecar-only

[中文](migration.md) | [English](migration.en.md)

This document covers safe migration from historical legacy/dual/patch implementations in this repository to the current `hermes_feishu_card/` sidecar-only mainline. Historical entry points are archived under `legacy/`, including `legacy/adapter/`, old `legacy/sidecar/`, old `legacy/patch/`, `legacy/installer.py`, `legacy/installer_sidecar.py`, `legacy/installer_v2.py`, `legacy/gateway_run_patch.py`, and `legacy/patch_feishu.py`. They are not the active runtime.

## Principles

- Back up first, then diagnose, then install. Any uncertain state should fail closed.
- Do not mix legacy/dual hooks with the sidecar-only hook.
- Do not commit App Secret, tenant token, real chat_id, logs, or screenshots containing private content.
- Do not manually copy old patch fragments into Hermes `gateway/run.py`.
- If Hermes files were changed by users or other tools, inspect the diff before continuing.

## Recommended Flow

1. Stop the current sidecar-only process if it has been started:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli stop --config config.yaml.example
```

2. Keep an external backup of the Hermes installation directory. Back up the whole Hermes directory, not just this repository.

3. If the current Hermes directory was installed by this sidecar-only plugin, restore first:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli restore --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
```

`restore` handles only state verified by the current manifest. V4.1 `manifest_version: 2` treats `gateway/run.py`, required Hermes 0.19 `gateway/platforms/base.py`, and optional Cron as one transaction; an incomplete target or backup never triggers partial restore. On changed source/backup, `install state incomplete`, or `newer installer required`, stop and inspect every managed target rather than fixing run alone.

4. If Hermes previously used historical legacy/dual scripts such as `legacy/installer_v2.py`, `legacy/gateway_run_patch.py`, or `legacy/patch_feishu.py`, restore from the original backup created by those scripts. If no trusted backup exists, reinstall or check out the matching Hermes version before migration.

5. Run read-only diagnostics:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config config.yaml.example --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
```

Continue only when the output says `hermes: supported` and `version`, `version_source`, `run_py_exists`, and `reason` match expectations.

6. Install the sidecar-only hook:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli install --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
```

The installer backs up every managed target, writes `manifest_version: 2`, and installs minimal calls into `hermes_feishu_card.hook_runtime`. For Hermes 0.19 / `v2026.7.20+` or verified exact-ledger source, required Base installs, restores, and rolls back with run. Feishu CardKit, session state, health metrics, and retry counts remain in the sidecar.

7. Start and inspect the sidecar:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli start --config config.yaml.example
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli status --config config.yaml.example
```

`status` should show `status: running`, `active_sessions`, and metrics. Without Feishu credentials, advanced starts use a no-op client. With credentials, the sidecar reads them only from local config or environment variables.

## Upgrading From V4.1.0 To V4.1.1

V4.1.1 fixes the boundary where disk state is current but a running sidecar still uses an old interpreter/package, as well as an incorrect fence while waiting for the first heartbeat. Continue to use official setup/install and never edit Hermes source manually:

```bash
hermes-feishu-card doctor --config CONFIG --hermes-dir HERMES_DIR --explain
hermes-feishu-card stop --config CONFIG
hermes-feishu-card setup --config CONFIG --hermes-dir HERMES_DIR --yes
```

Setup installs and rechecks V4.1.1 through the detected Hermes runtime venv and uses the package version and Python identity from `/health` to decide whether an old sidecar must restart. A running old sidecar without a pidfile is never silently adopted or killed. Stop that service manually and rerun setup; do not substitute a guessed PID or broad `pkill`.

Only when `doctor --explain` confirms an `installed` on-disk plan, sidecar health is unreachable, no pidfile exists in the state directory, and `manual_review_required` remains may you run:

```bash
hermes-feishu-card integrity acknowledge-review \
  --config CONFIG \
  --hermes-dir HERMES_DIR \
  --yes
```

An empty `pre_repair_runtime_hash` means runtime identity cannot prove a process transition, so operator acknowledgement may clear that otherwise unresolvable fence. A non-empty hash clears only the manual-review bit; the Gateway restart fence remains until a different runtime id sends a generation/package-matching `runtime.hello`. Then manually restart sidecar and Hermes Gateway and confirm ready through `doctor` / `/health`. Dirty targets, unknown manifests/backups, non-private state/fence files, or a remaining pidfile must be resolved first; `acknowledge-review` is not a force-clear command.

A legacy `0644` pidfile can be tightened in place to `0600` only inside a current-user-owned private `0700` state directory with a strictly matching shape and identity. Every other case fails closed.

## Upgrading From V4.1.3 To V4.1.4

V4.1.4 fixes the Windows legacy-install migration gap from Issue #171. If `.hermes_feishu_card_manifest` is missing while an older owned Gateway hook and `.hermes_feishu_card.bak` remain, rerun official `install` / `setup`. The installer rebuilds the manifest and upgrades the hook only when removing owned blocks restores the backup byte-for-byte, the backup is parseable clean source, and Cron/Base evidence independently matches.

Do not hand-create a manifest or call internal `apply_patch()` APIs. Unicode comments, CRLF, and native Windows path separators are not the reproduced root cause. An edit outside owned markers, a mismatched backup, a symlink, or unparseable source still fails closed and requires preserved files plus manual review.

```bash
hermes-feishu-card doctor --config CONFIG --hermes-dir HERMES_DIR --explain
hermes-feishu-card install --hermes-dir HERMES_DIR --yes
```

On Windows PowerShell, install V4.1.4 through the official `install.ps1` / `setup` flow. After `manifest: rebuilt` and `install ok`, restart Hermes Gateway and confirm that doctor reports install state `installed`.

## Upgrading From V4.1.2 To V4.1.3

V4.1.3 fixes the recovery convergence gap reproduced in Issue #158 after a real Hermes upstream update. Once official `install` reinjects the hook, the current integrity-plan fingerprint changes while the old manual-review fence remains bound to the pre-upgrade plan. `integrity acknowledge-review` can now atomically update that plan binding and clear manual review only after two verified-current-installed-plan checks, two stopped-sidecar checks, an unchanged fence CAS snapshot, and an exact match between the old and current Hermes target identity. A different target, remaining pidfile/health, dirty or unverifiable plan, or unknown legacy fence still fails closed. A non-empty restart hash remains until a new matching `runtime.hello` clears the independent restart fence.

This release also includes PR #168's same-name answer-delta callback selection and fixes Issue #169. After Hermes `1a3a9de` moved callbacks into `TurnRunner`, the official patcher restores stable tool, answer, thinking, clarify, approval, and status hooks through `TurnContext`. Doctor follows actual patchability; an unrecognized TurnRunner shape fails installation with `not safely patchable` and must not be bypassed by editing `gateway/run.py` manually.

Do not edit `runtime-integrity-fence.json` or call internal Python functions. When `doctor --explain` reports `integrity_migration_required`, run the displayed `integrity migrate-safe` command. For another verified manual-review fence, stop the sidecar, run the complete `integrity acknowledge-review --config CONFIG --hermes-dir PATH --state-dir STATE --yes` command printed by doctor, then manually restart the sidecar and Hermes Gateway.

## Upgrading From V4.1.1 To V4.1.2

V4.1.2 fixes the race where a brief stale-heartbeat window during a normal Gateway restart could be persisted as a restart fence. Upgrade through the official `setup` path and restart the Gateway once. After the new matching `runtime.hello`, readiness should return directly to `runtime_ready`. If restart-required remains, do not restart repeatedly; use `doctor --explain` to inspect generation/package, control authentication, and any existing fence.

## Upgrading To V4.1.0

V4.1.0 preserves cards as the default and does not silently mutate an old configuration. Upgrade the package and rerun setup/install first, then add only the controls you need:

```yaml
bindings:
  native_chats: []
card:
  table_overflow_mode: compact  # compact | truncate
integrity:
  mode: notify  # old configs remain notify until explicit migration
service:
  manager: auto  # auto | systemd-user | systemd-system | detached
```

`bindings.native_chats` uses exact matching. Manage it with `chats use-native`, `chats use-card`, and `chats list`; multi-profile commands require `--profile-id` and write only that profile. `table_overflow_mode: compact` retains table six onward without data loss, while `truncate` is the explicit legacy behavior. A terminal card JSON above 28,000 bytes returns the complete answer to Hermes native delivery.

An old config without `integrity` loads as `notify`. Only an installation with verified Git provenance, backup, manifest, owned blobs, and anchors can migrate explicitly:

```bash
hermes-feishu-card integrity migrate-safe \
  --config ~/.hermes/config.yaml \
  --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent \
  --yes
```

Success prints `sidecar.restart_required: true` and `gateway.restart_required: false`. Restart the sidecar before signed `runtime.hello` / `runtime.heartbeat` events are evaluated in safe mode. If strict repair later reinstalls the hook, state changes to `gateway.restart_required: true`, but HFC never restarts Gateway automatically. Incomplete evidence, user edits, symlinks, dirty targets, branch rewinds, and source-stripped roots remain fail closed.

`service.manager: auto` chooses only `systemd-user` or `detached`; it never silently enters `systemd-system` or invokes sudo. `systemd-system` is an explicit Linux transient-unit opt-in. Docker remains an ordinary container process with `detached`. Hermes 0.19.0 / `v2026.7.20` uses AST-owned run + Base hooks. A legacy run-only manifest gains the Base backup/patch and migrates to v2 only under strict evidence; runtime monitoring and strict repair handle upgrade replacement without an import-hook bridge.

## Upgrading To V3.4.0

V3.4.0+ selects the hook strategy from the Hermes version and `gateway/run.py` code anchors. Hermes `0.13.0+`, `0.14.0` / `v2026.5.16+` uses `gateway_run_013_plus`; older Hermes from `v2026.4.23` through `v2026.4.x` continues to use `legacy_gateway_run`. After upgrading the plugin, reinstall the hook; restarting the sidecar alone is not enough.

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli stop --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
pip install -e ".[test]" --upgrade
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli install --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli start --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
```

`doctor` output should include `hook_strategy`, `compatibility`, and anchors. If Hermes has been upgraded to `0.13.0+`, `0.14.0`, or `v2026.5.16+`, confirm `hook_strategy: gateway_run_013_plus` before installing; older `v2026.4.x` Hermes should continue to report `legacy_gateway_run`.

For multiple independent Hermes profile processes, set a stable `HERMES_FEISHU_CARD_PROFILE_ID` for each process. This avoids ambiguous automatic profile detection and keeps profile-to-bot routing explicit. A single sidecar serving multiple profiles should still use the `profiles` section for each profile's credentials, bots, and card title.

## Upgrading From V3.1 To V3.2.1

V3.2.1 is **backward compatible** with V3.1 on the sidecar-only architecture. Single-bot configurations continue to work without changes; to use the new multi-bot / group chat binding features, the configuration must be extended.

### Upgrade Steps

1. **Back up current config**

   ```bash
   cp ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml.v3.1.backup
   ```

2. **Stop the sidecar (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli stop --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
   ```

3. **Update code to V3.2.1**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/hermes-feishu-streaming-card
   git checkout v3.2.1  # or the latest tag
   python3 -m pip install -e ".[test]" --upgrade
   ```

4. **Update configuration**

   Option A: Use CLI to generate an updated template (preserves existing config, adds V3.2.1 fields)
   ```bash
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli setup --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml --yes
   ```
   This supplements the existing `config.yaml` with new top-level fields (`bots`, `bindings`, etc.) without overwriting existing values.

   Option B: Manual merge (see `config.yaml.example` for a complete sample)
   - Add a `bots:` list under `hermes:` (at least one bot; its `app_id`/`app_secret` can be inherited from the original single-bot fields)
   - Add a `bindings:` section with `fallback_bot` and optional `chats:` mappings
   - The old `feishu.app_id` / `feishu.app_secret` are still valid in single-bot mode, but migrating to `bots[0]` is recommended for consistency

5. **Validate configuration**

   ```bash
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
   ```
   Expect `config: valid` and correct detection of `bots` / `bindings` fields.

6. **Restart sidecar**

   ```bash
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli start --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
   python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli status --config ~/.hermes_feishu_card/config.yaml
   ```

7. **Functional validation**
   - Send a card message in a 1-to-1 or group chat to confirm normal rendering
   - If multi-bot is configured, check `/health.routing` for routing stats
   - Run `cli bots list` to verify the bot registry

### Compatibility Notes

- V3.1 single-bot configs **continue to work** on V3.2.1 without modification (old fields still supported)
- V3.2.1's multi-bot features are optional; if `bindings.chats` is unset, all conversations route to `bindings.fallback_bot`
- Environment variables `FEISHU_APP_ID` / `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` remain effective in V3.2.1, but `config.yaml`'s `bots[]` takes precedence
- To roll back to V3.1: stop the sidecar, restore the backed-up `config.yaml`, and reinstall the V3.1 version

### Important Notes

- Each bot used in multi-bot mode must be created in the Feishu Open Platform with `send_message` and `update_message` permissions
- Group chat bindings require `chat_id` (obtained from the Feishu client or API), not the group name
- After upgrading, it is recommended to run `pytest -q` locally to ensure all tests pass

## Rollback

To roll back:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli stop --config config.yaml.example
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli restore --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
```

If `restore` refuses to overwrite, do not force-delete a hook. Compare run, required Base, optional Cron, each installer backup, the manifest, and external backups before manual recovery. A future-version manifest must be handled by its matching newer installer.

## Verification Checklist

- `doctor --config ... --hermes-dir ...` prints `hermes: supported`.
- `install --hermes-dir ... --yes` prints `install ok`.
- `start --config ...` prints `start ok` or `start: already running`.
- `status --config ...` prints `/health` metrics.
- Hermes native text still works when the sidecar is unavailable.
- `gateway/run.py` does not contain both legacy/dual and sidecar-only hooks.
